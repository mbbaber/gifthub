Ironhack Project #2
From March to June 2018, I attended a Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp in Paris with Ironhack.

The program was full-time, intensive bootcamp, where I learned the following tech:

Angular 5
Node.js
MongoDB
Mongoose
Express.js
Javascript & Typescript
HTML 5 / CSS 3
GitHub
Bash CLI

GiftHub is the second of three projects I did during the bootcamp. It was created with my fellow Ironhacker @lucasm-git.

>>Here's the app!
Context
We built this project after five weeks of learning. At this point, we had covered:

advanced HTML 5 & CSS 3 manipulation
advanced JS manipulations
Handlebars
Heroku app hosting platform
back-end stack:
Node.js
Express.js
MongoDB
Mongoose

The insctructions were to create an app that would:

have a data model with various Schemas
have a signup/login/logout users with various levels of authorizations
use CRUD (Create / Read / Update / Delete) methods over the app's data

What is the app about?
Exchanging gifts can often be a headache, be it for close relatives or simple acquaintances. Our app aims to ease this process by making it collaborative, so everyone can add their opinions and discuss the best gift for everyone.

Basically, the app works around "rooms", or events where you're supposed to bring gifts. People join the room, and have access to two things:

their own "wall", on which they can present gift ideas they'd like for themselves

other people's walls, on which they can:

see what people proposed for themselves
add gift ideas for them (without the person concerned being able to see it)
chat with other people about gift ideas
upvote gifts ideas. When they do, the list is rearranged to show most upvoted ideas at the top
claim a gift, so that everybody knows who buys what
This way, you don't have to come up with gift ideas on your own and can be sure everyone will have the gift that pleases them the most!

How does the tech work?
We created a referencing data model
We determined what users have access to what sections and who can modify what.

For the "walls", we used two different Handlebars partials to display one's own wall and other regular walls.

All CSS was done by hand.

Hope you enjoyed using it, and don't hesitate to give me any feedback!
